project on image recognization

   project on image recognition through IBM cloud visual recognition CAD_PHASE1: In this partunderstand the problem statement and create a document on the understanding and how to proceed ahead with solving the problem. Please think on a design and present in form of a document. 

Problem Definition: The project involves creating an image recognition system using IBM Cloud Visual Recognition. The goal is to develop a platform where users can upload images, and the system accurately classifies and describes the image contents. This will enable users to craft engaging visual stories with the help of AI-generated captions, enhancing their connection with the audience through captivating visuals and compelling narratives.

Design Thinking:

Image Recognition Setup: Set up the IBM Cloud Visual Recognition service and obtain the necessary API keys.

User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface for users to upload images and view the AI-generated captions.

Image Classification: Implement the image classification process using the IBM Cloud Visual Recognition API.

AI-Generated Captions: Integrate natural language generation to create captions for the recognized images.

User Engagement: Design features to allow users to explore, save, and share their AIenhanced images.

CAD_PHASE2: In this section needput the design into innovation to solve the problem. Create a document around it and share the same for assessment as per the instructions

Consider incorporating sentiment analysis to generate captions that capture the emotions and mood of the images

CAD_PHASE3: In this part begin building your project.

Start building the image recognition system using IBM Cloud Visual Recognition.

Create an IBM Cloud account, set up the Visual Recognition service, and obtain API keys.

Design a simple web interface where users can upload images and view the AI-generated captions.

CAD_PHASE4:

In this part continue building your project.

Continue building the image recognition system by integrating IBM Cloud Visual Recognition and AI-generated captions.

Implement the image classification process using the IBM Cloud Visual Recognition API.

Use natural language generation to create captions for the recognized images.

CAD_PHASE5:

In this part document your project and prepare it for submission.

Document the image recognition project and prepare it for submission.

Outline the project's objective, design thinking process, and development phases. Describe the user interface, technical implementation details, and integration of IBM Cloud Visual Recognition. Explain how AI-generated captions enhance user engagement and storytelling.
